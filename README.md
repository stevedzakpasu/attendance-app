# Attendance Application API

* This is the backend for a [mobile application](https://github.com/stevedzakpasu/attendance-app-frontend) used to take attendance.

* This project inspired the development of [QRollEase](https://github.com/stevedzakpasu/QRollEase-Mobile).

* I am no longer working on this project and an improved version of it can be found at [QRollEase=Backend](https://github.com/stevedzakpasu/QRollEase-Backend)
